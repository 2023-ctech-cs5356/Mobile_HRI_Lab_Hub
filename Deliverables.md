1. Link to the folder of a ROS package that contains a publisher and a subscriber


2. List 5 questions you have about ROS following the tutorial, answers you have found and things you still don't get
    - The rqt_graph sometimes does not show the publisher and subscriber nodes. Why?
    - How do I create a publisher that stops?
    - How do I create a publisher that reacts differently to subscribers' feedback messages? (e.g. a publisher that sends a message to a subscriber and the subscriber sends a message back to the publisher)
    - Can a subscriber send a message to a publisher?
    - How do I create a package out of this?

3. Feedback on the bootcamp: What was easy and what was difficult to understand?
    - What was easy: The tutorial was easy to follow and the explanations were clear.
    - What was difficult: The rqt_graph sometimes did not show the publisher and subscriber nodes. I had to restart the nodes to make it work. It's a bit confusing.

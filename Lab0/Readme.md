# Mobile Robot Bootcamp

For the first lab, we will just focus on getting everyone set up with ROS 2 and ready to program and build robots.

*Frank, add instructions and links here.*

## Set up your Course Github Repo

Fork the [Mobile HRI Lab Page repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Mobile_HRI_Lab_Hub); detailed instructions for creating your lab hub and updating your labs are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2022Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).

When submitting your assignments, you will update your assignments on your class lab hub, and post a link to your Github lab page on Canvas. Graders will review the assignments sometime after the due date. Late assignments (e.g. your assignment is missing/incomplete at our grading time, which is after the due date) will be penalized by one letter grade per day late.
